# Odin Recipes 🍽️

Welcome to **Odin Recipes** – a basic recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project focuses purely on **HTML** and serves as my first step into web development.

## 🔥 What I Built

- A multi-page recipe website using only **HTML**
- A homepage with links to individual recipe pages
- Each recipe includes:
  - Title
  - Ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Images to visually support the recipe

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing semantic, well-structured **HTML**
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages together
- Organizing content with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
- Using relative paths for navigation and images
- Understanding basic file structure for a website project

## 🌐 Live Demo

(Optionally, add a GitHub Pages link here if deployed.)

## 🚧 What's Next

I'll continue through the curriculum by learning **CSS** to improve the layout and styling of this site. Stay tuned!
